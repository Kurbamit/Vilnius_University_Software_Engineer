Program works with files. 
Input file's name is obtained by command line.

File EXAMPLE:
- Up to 1000 lines.
- First line is header, so it has to be printed in output file.
- Each line has six columns.
- 1-2 columns contain string.
- 3-5 columns contain integers [-100;100].
- 6th column contain real number [-9.99;9.99] with two decimal point numbers.
  
Program checks each line and prints out number of lines, that doesn't have
symbol 'B' nor 'C' in first two columns.
