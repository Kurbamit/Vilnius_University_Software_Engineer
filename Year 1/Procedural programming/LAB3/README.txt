This program reads text from file.
Changes string in that way:
  *If there is same symbols going one after another it leaves one symbol, puts '$' and 'number of symbols'
  *Else it leaves symbol as is.

Example:
  INPUT: "Hello, world!"
  OUTPUT: "Hel$2o, world!"
  
  INPUT: "AAASAP"
  OUTPUT: "A$3P"
